Besides our auditing, JC&amp;Company also provides us with tax planning ideas when structuring our cross border transactions, as well as helping us to ensure compliance with U.S. tax law. I am happy to continue this successful relationship with them. Why haven&rsquo;t we considered other accounting firms in all these years?  Because JC&amp;Company gives us exceptional service.

Our decision to bring them in was based on their experience, competency, capabilities and, as in most relationships, how well we fit and get along. They&rsquo;re good people, and I&rsquo;m glad that we work with them.&rdquo;

						p 	&ldquo;When my relationship with JC&amp;Company first commenced last year, I was quite candid with them. I told them we were a small company that does not have well established HR or Accounting department and that we were rookies when it came to financial reporting and international accounting and taxes. They were exceptionally patient and resourceful, helping me and our management group to understand what all the reporting and compliance requirements meant and why they were directed at us. Whenever a question arises, JC&amp;Company is a phone call away. We rely on them to answer questions and assist us through processes all the time. They not only help with our accounting and taxes, but even supported and guided us through a major switch in accounting programs. They are always looking out for our best interest and often times get more involved in something that they are not required to in order to make sure we have all the tools to be successful. In my opinion, JC&amp;Company goes above and beyond and they have been a really great partner.&rdquo;

						p 	&ldquo;After going through a number of traditional CPAs, I met John and his team and I immediately realized that he understood the tax and accounting issues of my company as well as mine. At the first meeting, he provided me with a comprehensive, but succinct, explanation about the issues I should consider as I managed an U.S subsidiary of a foreign company. I was truly glad that I finally found an accounting firm I can trust and depend on, and this was especially important to me because, although our parent company had good reputation and resources in Korea, the business in the U.S. was completely new to me and all my company members.  Simply put, John and his team are impeccable professionals.&rdquo;
